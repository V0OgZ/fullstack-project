- **BuildingService**: Construction and upgrade logic  
- **ScenarioService**: Objective tracking and event processing
- **GameService**: Turn processing and resource management

### **⚠️ FRONTEND CLEANUP NEEDED**
**TODO**: Remove duplicate logic from frontend:
- Move PoliticalAdvisorService logic to backend AI
- Consolidate magic item calculations in backend
- Use backend APIs for all game state changes
- Frontend should only handle UI rendering and user input
