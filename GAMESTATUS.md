# 🎮 Heroes Reforged - Game Status Report

## 📊 **Project Overview**

**Heroes Reforged** is an ambitious strategy game project that aims to combine:
- **Complete Heroes of Might & Magic III functionality** (8 castles, 70+ spells, 150+ artifacts)
- **Revolutionary ZFC (Zone de Causalité) System** for asynchronous gameplay
- **Perestroika-inspired Political System** with deep strategic decision making
- **Modern Canvas Interface** with 60 FPS hexagonal rendering

---

## 🚨 **CRITICAL DISCREPANCIES IDENTIFIED**

### ❌ **1. Environment Setup Issues**
- **Problem**: Frontend dependencies are completely missing (all UNMET DEPENDENCY errors)
- **Impact**: Application cannot run or build
- **Root Cause**: `node_modules` not installed, package-lock.json may be corrupted
- **Priority**: **CRITICAL** - Must fix before any development can continue

### ❌ **2. Backend Environment Missing**
- **Problem**: Maven not installed on system (`mvn: command not found`)
- **Impact**: Backend cannot compile or run
- **Root Cause**: Development environment not properly configured
- **Priority**: **CRITICAL** - Backend services unavailable

### ❌ **3. Documentation vs Implementation Gap**
- **Problem**: Documentation claims extensive features that don't exist in code
- **Examples**:
  - Claims 30+ magical objects implemented → Only data structure exists
  - Claims ZFC system fully functional → Only basic calculation exists
  - Claims political advisor system → Not implemented in code
  - Claims 60 FPS Canvas rendering → Basic Canvas implementation only

### ❌ **4. Architecture Inconsistencies**
- **Problem**: Documentation describes advanced features not reflected in codebase
- **Examples**:
  - Claims unified dual-scenario system → Only basic scenario switching
  - Claims complete HoMM3 feature set → Only basic hero movement
  - Claims temporal mechanics → Only basic timeline structure
  - Claims political system → No implementation found
