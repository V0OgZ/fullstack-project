## ⚡ **The Epic Encounter**

**The Eye of Wigner** glimmers atop the ruined tower. Arthur approaches cautiously - this legendary artifact can force reality itself to collapse.

*"Sire, don't touch it!"* Lysandrel shouts from the valley. *"If you activate it now, all our future actions will become real instantly!"*
But Arthur sees the enemy army approaching. In a few turns, they'll be overwhelmed. He has only one choice: seize the Eye and **force the causal collapse**.
