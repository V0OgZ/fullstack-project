# Terrain & Vision System Implementation Summary

## üéØ Implementation Overview (January 2025)

### What Was Implemented

1. **Hex Bitmask System** (`frontend/src/utils/hexBitmask.ts`)
   - Calculates 6-bit mask for neighboring tiles of same terrain type
   - Supports pointy-top hexagonal grid with axial coordinates
   - Enables intelligent edge/border sprite selection

2. **Terrain Sprite Mapping** (`frontend/src/constants/terrainSprites.ts`)
   - Added bitmask-to-sprite mappings for grass, forest, water terrains
   - Supports center, edge, and isolated tile sprites
   - Fallback to gradient rendering if sprites unavailable

3. **Movement Range Visualization**
   - **Green overlay**: Immediate movement range (current turn)
   - **Blue overlay**: Projection range (ZFC future turns, 2x movement points)
   - Overlays render on top of terrain but under units/structures

4. **Fog of War System**
   - **Three visibility states**:
     - Clear: Currently visible (within vision radius)
     - 55% black: Previously explored but not currently visible
     - 85% black: Never explored
   - Vision radius: 4 tiles (Manhattan distance) from each hero
   - Updates automatically when game loads or heroes move

5. **Error Handling**
   - Fixed `createPattern` error for broken/missing sprite images
   - Graceful fallback to color gradients when sprites fail

### Key Files Modified

- `ModernGameRenderer.tsx`: Integrated bitmask sprites, movement highlights, fog overlay
- `useGameStore.ts`: Added `updateVision()` method and `isExplored` tile tracking
- `TrueHeroesInterface.tsx`: Auto-calls `updateVision()` on game load
- `types/game.ts`: Added `isExplored` boolean to Tile interface

### Testing

- Unit tests for bitmask calculation and vision updates
- E2E Playwright tests for visual verification (with screenshots)
- Demo button removed from home page as requested

### Current Status

‚úÖ **Fully functional** - All terrain & vision features working in game
‚úÖ **Tests passing** - Single player demo tests work correctly
‚ö†Ô∏è **Multiplayer tests failing** - Pre-existing issue, not related to this implementation
‚úÖ **Documentation updated** - Technical docs and developer instructions updated

### Next Steps

1. Add more terrain types to bitmask mappings (mountain, desert, swamp)
2. Create actual sprite assets for terrain transitions
3. Implement more complex bitmask patterns (corners, triple edges)
4. Add vision bonuses for elevated terrain or watchtowers
5. Optimize rendering performance for large maps

### Known Issues

- Sprite loading currently falls back to gradients (no actual sprite files yet)
- Multiplayer session creation has UI issues (unrelated to terrain system)
- Some E2E tests need updating for new UI changes
